IF PYAUDIO GIVES ERROR:

>>
The error "Could not import the PyAudio C module 'pyaudio._portaudio'" occurs because PyAudio
relies on a low-level library called PortAudio, and it's possible that the PortAudio library
is not installed on your system or not configured correctly.

Here's what you can try:

If you are using Windows, you can try installing the Microsoft Visual C++ build tools before installing PyAudio.
You can download them from the official Microsoft website: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/

Try installing PyAudio using a pre-built wheel that includes the PortAudio library.

You can download the appropriate wheel file for your system from https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pyaudio.
Make sure to download the wheel file that matches your Python version and system architecture (32-bit or 64-bit).
Once you've downloaded the file, install it using pip, like so:  pip install path/to/wheel_file.whl


if the above steps do not work, you may need to manually install the PortAudio library on your system.
You can download it from the official PortAudio website: http://www.portaudio.com/download.html.
After downloading the appropriate version for your system, extract the contents of the archive and
add the folder containing the portaudio.h header file to your system's include path, and
the folder containing the compiled library file (libportaudio.so or libportaudio.dylib on Unix-like systems, or
portaudio_x86.dll or portaudio_x64.dll on Windows) to your system's library path. You can then try reinstalling PyAudio using pip.
